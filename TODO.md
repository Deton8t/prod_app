# TODO:

- [ ] Use fzf to help user identify potential apps in these folders:
    - /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/
    - /usr/bin/
    - and more maybe, explore the $PATH variable, maybe just 
    parse $PATH honestly
- [ ] Add tabs for selected apps to manage how they are being restricted
- [ ] Make general UI improvements
